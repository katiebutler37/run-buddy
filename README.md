# <Run-Buddy-HTML-CSS-Coding-Exercise>

## Description

- The Run Buddy repository was created referring to steps and templates provided by University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies Coding Bootcamp for creating a web home page and privacy policy page.
- This project was created to strengthen my proficiency working with HTML structuring and CSS styling through application and practice. 
- The Run Buddy application is meant to match clients with trainers for running support through tools such as a sign-up form, an introduction to the trainer profiles, and a reach-out page component.  
- Building the Run Buddy repository and subsequent directory and files helped to learn how to interact with computer file systems using command line, create an HTML document, apply meaning, context and functionality to that document using HTML attributes, and interpret a mock-up given to me by designers. I also learned how to use Git to create that repository and save project process, publish to GitHub to allow for collaboration, apply style and layout to HTML using CSS and generally strengthened my knowledge of the webdesign process. 

## Installation

Each of the repository file pages may be opened in VS Code for further project development. VS Code is a free application that can be downloaded to your computer from the internet. The project contains a home page [index.html](./index.html)  and a privacy policy page [privacy-policy.html](./privacy-policy.html), two linked CSS stylesheets and relevant images. These are provided in [assets](./assets/). 

## Usage

The Run Buddy landing page was created based on the following Mock Up.

    ```md
    ![Mock Up](./assets/images/Run%20Buddy%20Mock%20Up.jpeg)
    ```

It includes a few functionalities, such as a navigation bar to bring the user through the page to a desired section, branding including a hyperlinked page title to return to the home page, a link to the privacy policy page found in the footer, an interactive iframe Google map and a sign-up form.

Run Buddy is not a real company or application, but an example for learning purposes. It is not a fully functioning website linked to back-end coding, simply an exercise in following front-end design requests.
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
